How to work with a script
1) The script is run by the /patient page. Data about the patient undergoing the test should be entered on it and press the "Send" button. The data is automatically entered into the database.
2) After redirecting to the /questionnaire page, the user should answer ALL the questions asked and press the "Send" button.
3) After redirecting to the /result page, the user receives the test results.

Remark: Every day at 23:59, data on patients who have not passed the test for more than 24 hours will be deleted.
